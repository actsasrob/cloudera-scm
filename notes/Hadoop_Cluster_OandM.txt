## YARN Configuration

Inventory the vcores, memory, and disks available on each worker node
# Calculate the resources needed for other processes
– Reserve 3GB or 20% of total memory for the OS
– Reserve resources for any non-Hadoop applicaFons
– Reserve resources for other any Hadoop components
– HDFS caching (if configured), NodeManager, DataNode
– Impalad, HBase RegionServer, Solr, etc.
# Grant the resources not used by the above to your YARN containers
# Configure the YARN scheduler and application framework settings
– Based on the worker node profile determined above
– Determine the number of containers needed to best support YARN applicaFons based on the type of workload
– Monitor usage and tune esFmated values to find optimal settings
